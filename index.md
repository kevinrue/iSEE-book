# Preface {-}

The [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) package *[iSEE](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/iSEE)* provides functions to create an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) using the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) *[Shiny](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Shiny)* package for exploring data stored in *[SummarizedExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/SummarizedExperiment)* objects [@rue2018isee].
This book describes how to use *[iSEE](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/iSEE)*'s application programming interface (API) to develop new panel types for custom visualizations.
We also present case studies to illustrate the development process for a variety of custom panels.

The contents of this book are intended for developers of custom panel classes, usually inside a dedicated package like *[iSEEu](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/iSEEu)*.
Potential end-users of *[iSEE](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/iSEE)* should refer to the vignettes provided on the package landing page.
